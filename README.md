# Drum-kit
I built a drum kit using JavaScript. The project includes interactive features that allow users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys or clicking on the drum elements on the screen. The implementation involves event listeners, audio elements, and dynamic styling to create a responsive and engaging musical experience.
